##---------------

Step 4: Push ‚¨ÜÔ∏é to GitHub
Run the following code in the console: file.edit("gitignore")
Copy and paste the following code into the gitignore file:
First Set run
.Rproj.user
.Rhistory
.RData
.Ruserdata
.DS_Store

blogdown::check_site()

Then add these to gitignore file
Thumbs.db
/public/
/resources/
.hugo_build.lock




Before we make our first commit, we use blogdown to check all our files:

blogdown::check_site()
Two boxes come up click save twice


options(blogdown.hugo.version = "0.93.3")

    


Step 5: Deploy site with Netlify
Go to Netlify and sign up using your github profile
netlify.com
Click on Sites
Click on Add New Sites
Click on Import an Existing Project
Click on GitHub and it should link up
Click on the repository that connects to your repository
Scroll down on the next page to Deploy Site
Wait for Deploy bots
Click Custom Domain





Back in RStudio, change the baseurl to your new link in your configuration file:

install.packages("rstudioapi")
library(rstudioapi) # to easily navigate to files
rstudioapi::navigateToFile("config.yaml") OR
Go to the config folder click default, open config.yaml
Do a control find for 'baseurl' and remove 'https://academic-demo.netlify.app/' and add your website name in quotes

do a check - blogdown::check_site()


Double check HUGO locally and the version by Netlify  are  the same version  
make sure that the version of Hugo that you are using locally with {blogdown} matches the version used by Netlify (which is specified in netlify.toml). You will likely need to change your netlify.toml file.
rstudioapi::navigateToFile("netlify.toml") 
    
    
Step 6: Customize your site with Wowchemy üé®
    
    
Change Contact page:
The core parameters for the website can be edited in the config/_default/params.yaml file.

Change the Menu:
The main menu links in the navigation bar can be edited in the config/_default/menu.yaml file.
